### ðŸª„ Magic characters

This little tool will put an invisible character called a zero-width non-joiner <code>&amp;zwnj;</code> into
the clipboard for you. By default, it wraps it in Liquid/DotLiquid <code>{%raw%}{%endraw%}</code> tags so
it's traceable in a text editor.

_Why would I do this?_ - You can use it to force an SMS to upgrade from GSM-7 to UCS-8!
